&lt;p&gt;Do you have what it takes to beat all 1000 levels in this fast paced platformer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stairs 1000 is a fast-paced platformer for casual players with progressively increasing difficulty that will bring ultimate challenge even for the best players with the final goal of beating level 1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game is very casual and relaxing for the first 300 levels where you slowly jump from stair to stair, levels 300-600 are challenging for most of the players, and the last 400 levels are for the best of the best with super quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level 1000 seems to be unreachable at the beginning, but with hours of practice, anyone can beat that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checkpoints in the game are every 100 levels. This means you can quickly jump into challenging fast-paced levels without slow poking through levels for casuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a HARDCORE mode for those who reached a score of 700 or higher. This mode gives a game new twist that makes gameplay much harder and is for gamers who are looking for the real challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you the one who will beat all 1000 levels? Do you have what it takes to unlock HARDCORE mode? Prove yourself worthy and beat that game!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">1000 Stairs is multiplatform mobile game made in Unity with fast paced levels with increasing difficulty</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://sevcik.dev/assets/img/1000-stairs.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://sevcik.dev/assets/img/1000-stairs.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">1000 Stairs T&amp;amp;C</title><link href="https://sevcik.dev/portfolio/1000-stairs-terms" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="1000 Stairs T&amp;C" /><published>2020-03-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://sevcik.dev/portfolio/1000-stairs-terms</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sevcik.dev/portfolio/1000-stairs-terms">&lt;p&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/p&gt;

I would describe myself as Full Stack Splunk, React and (to be) Blockchain Developer.

I've always been driven by a passion to learn new things. To briefly describe my programming journey, I've started creating mobile apps (Swift and Java) and later focused towards web applications (jQuery first, Vue.js next and now React/Next.js) but my professional focus shifted to the Splunk (Python, JavaScript and Unix work) - why? - I have received like 4x better offer and committed to become a Splunk developer. However, I've been still building web apps and fell in love with Next.js.

I am not new to crypto, actually, I've been mining bitcoin in 2013 but mined only mindblowing 0.00000273 BTC. That's not even full dolar with the current price. However, I've fully dived into the crypto world just at the start of 2021. Since then I've watched hundreds of hours of educational videos about cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects, and finally invested some serious money.

I've started following the NEAR protocol just a few weeks ago and have already decided to invest in it. I've finished NEAR academy, and during this and next week I am attending NEAR Certified Instructor, and this week I've completed NEAR Certified Developer I and II by building my very first smart contract on NEAR blockchain. I was curious and I noticed the career section on near.org website and what surprised me was that a very promising project like NEAR that I decided to invest in is looking for front-end developers who are using my very favorite framework Next.js.

I would love to work for NEAR as front-end developer in Next.js. I believe that such work will give me hands-on experience with blockchain projects and will be my entry ticket into the Web3 World.

I am looking forward to hearing back from you and I would love to hear back even with other position offers. I would even love to work as a Rust developer but I will keep this for the future due to the steeper learning curve and lack of experience.

# COVER LETTER

I would describe myself as Full Stack Splunk, React and (to be) Blockchain Developer.

I've always been driven by a passion to learn new things. To briefly describe my programming journey, I've started creating mobile apps (Swift and Java) and later focused towards web applications (jQuery first, Vue.js next and now React/Next.js) but my professional focus shifted to the Splunk (Python, JavaScript and Unix work) - why? - I have received like 4x better offer and committed to become a Splunk developer. However, I've been still building web apps and I fell in love with Next.js.

I am not new to crypto, actually, I've been mining bitcoin in 2013 but mined only mindblowing 0.00000273 BTC. That's not even full dolar with the current price. However, I've fully dived into the crypto world just at the start of 2021. Since then I've watched hundreds of hours of educational videos about cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects, and finally invested some serious money.

I've started following the NEAR protocol just a few weeks ago and have already decided to invest in it. I've finished NEAR academy, and during this and next week I am attending NEAR Certified Instructor, and this week I've completed NEAR Certified Developer I and II by building my very first smart contract on NEAR blockchain.

I was going through NEAR documentation and I've noticed that Aurora is creating NEAR <> ETH bridge. Somehow, I did found Aurora's careers section and I've been pleasantly surprised when I read about Front-End Developer stack of Next.js, Typescript, web3 and Tailwind CSS. I just smiled because working with favorites Next.js and Tailwind would be my dream job and I told my self that I will have to send the application.

I am looking forward to hearing back from you and I would love to hear back even with other position offers. I would even love to work as a Rust developer but I will keep this for the future due to the steeper learning curve and lack of experience.

  <li>Have working Jekyll template (even though it is lame without design), site is running on sevcik.dev</li>
  <li>Added deploy script for Jekyll so I donâ€™t need to write same code over and over again</li>
  <li>Almost all filters in WTC are working (except time), need to figure out how to filter time as it varies a lot by difficulty</li>
</ol>

title: Day 1 - Changing style with Bulma
---
1. I was able to add Bulma css to this blog.
2. Changed styles of blog and posts so they look nicer with Bulma.
3. Added inheritance of `.list` and `.list-item` to `ul`, `ol` and `li` so the text from markdown is properly formated. For example this list now looks cool :)

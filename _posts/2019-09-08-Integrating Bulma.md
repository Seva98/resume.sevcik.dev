title: Day 1 - Changing style with Bulma
---
## WTC
1. Change a way how times are saved
2. Filtering by time now works however I need to enter new sample WODs

## Jekyll
1. I was able to add Bulma css to this blog.
2. Changed styles of blog and posts so they look nicer with Bulma.
3. Added inheritance of `.list` and `.list-item` to `ul`, `ol` and `li` so the text from markdown is properly formated. For example this list now looks cool :)

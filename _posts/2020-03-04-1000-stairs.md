## Description

Stairs 1000 is a fast-paced platformer for casual players with progressively increasing difficulty that will bring ultimate challenge even for the best players with the final goal of beating level 1000.

Game is very casual and relaxing for the first 300 levels where you slowly jump from stair to stair, levels 300-600 are challenging for most of the players, and the last 400 levels are for the best of the best with super quick.

Level 1000 seems to be unreachable at the beginning, but with hours of practice, anyone can beat that.

Checkpoints in the game are every 100 levels. This means you can quickly jump into challenging fast-paced levels without slow poking through levels for casuals.

There is also a HARDCORE mode for those who reached a score of 700 or higher. This mode gives a game new twist that makes gameplay much harder and is for gamers who are looking for the real challenge.

Are you the one who will beat all 1000 levels? Do you have what it takes to unlock HARDCORE mode? Prove yourself worthy and beat that game!

Custom Splunk's app with a collection of multiple dashboards that interprets important key performance indicators for use in energetics.

Worked on this project in team of 2.

My work included developing one of those dashboards from scratch, improving the efficiency of those dashboards by optimizing SPL search queries, preparing the app for multi-lingual use with i18n package, and fixing several bugs on older dashboards.

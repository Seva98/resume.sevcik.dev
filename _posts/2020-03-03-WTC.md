WOD Time Calculator is my pet project that already had several major realeases. The latest major update happened in the begging of 2020.

WTC has been created in Vue.js for frontend and with MongoDB Stitch for backend to make app truly serverless.

WTC also includes premium membership section using PayPal API which is connected via MongoDB Stitch.

On top of that MongoDB Stitch is also used for authentitication, cron jobs, webhooks and cloud functions.<!--more-->

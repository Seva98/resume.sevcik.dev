  Some people believe that men never have libido issues as if they were ever-hungry sex machines always longing for some fresh meat to have fun with. That couldn‚Äôt be MORE wrong that it already sounds.
</p>

<p class="space">
  Decrease or loss in sex drive is a health condition like any other, and this is true for both men and women alike. The possible reasons are manifold: chronic fatigue, stress, concurrent illnesses, depression, poor nutrition, bad habits‚Ä¶ We could go on with this list for hours on end.
</p>

<p class="space">
  The question is: what can YOU do to help yourself? Is there a way to naturally boost your libido without having to resort to some heavy pharmaceutical artillery or expensive psychotherapy?
</p>

<p class="space">
  Of course, there is! To boost your sex drive the natural way all you have to do is eat the right stuff.
</p>

<p class="space">
  Gentlemen, men the ultimate list of aphrodisiacs: foods that can easily boost your libido if you eat the stuff daily. Let‚Äôs go!
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #1: Oysters

<p class="space">
  This one is an all-time favorite. According to legends, oysters were among the favorite foods of such prominent figures like the Egyptian queen Cleopatra and Don Juan, the libertine heartbreaker (he had a real-life prototype, in case if you didn‚Äôt know), as these slimy mollusks helped them to stay in good shape for their amorous achievements. We don‚Äôt know about Cleopatra, but Don Juan was likely right: oysters are insanely rich in zinc, which is a confirmed testosterone booster. More testosterone = enhanced sex drive. Way to go!
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #2: Asparagus

<p class="space">
  This one can be quite problematic to put your hands on (at least in some regions) but trust me, it‚Äôs worth the effort. Asparagus is a powerful natural source of vitamin B, a nutrient that‚Äôs essential to ensure healthy nerve transmission. Both libido and erectile function heavily rely on the health of your autonomous (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nervous system, so keep it fit with enough vitamin B.
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #3: Watermelon

<p class="space">
  Watermelon contains citrulline, an amino acid that‚Äôs converted in the human body into arginine, another amino acid. The latter is the precursor for nitric oxide, the most powerful systemic vasodilator in the human body, and one of the most important components to ensure rock-hard erections. And let‚Äôs face the truth for a second here: it‚Äôs hard to NOT want sex when you‚Äôve got a massive boner waiting to be put to good work.
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #4: Avocados

<p class="space">
  Besides being a delicious and utterly healthy food rich in so-called ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù fats (namely MUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids), avocados are scientifically confirmed testosterone boosters. Being the primary male hormone, the big T plays a great role in ensuring healthy libido in any man.
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #5: Pumpkin Seeds

<p class="space">
  Just like the first item on this list (oysters), pumpkin seeds are a wonderful source of zinc ‚Äì a foolproof testosterone booster. Also, they are the perfect snack to munch on the go if you care for your health and physique, packed with a whole bunch of healthy fibers and beneficial nutrients like vitamin B, C, E, D, and K.
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #6: Maca

<p class="space">
  Maca is a Latin American favorite. Maca root is sometimes even referred to as ‚Äúthe Peruvian Viagra‚Äù for its ability to enhance erectile function, boost fertility, and spark sex drive. Additionally, maca is a rich source of antioxidants ‚Äì natural anti-inflammatory agents that could alleviate the course of any chronic illnesses you might have, as sometimes they can mess up sex drive quite badly.
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #7: Cocoa & Chocolate

<p class="space">
  Do you know why millions of people around the world absolutely LOVE chocolate? It doesn‚Äôt even have to be sweet: the bitter kinds are also fabulous. Most likely, cocoa and chocolate are so popular due to the high amount of flavonoids present in them ‚Äì natural phytochemicals that show prominent anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and endorphin-like action. Chocolate literally makes you feel happy, and there‚Äôs no way around it: it works. Taking into account that one of the most common reasons for low sex drive is chronic stress and depression, treating yourself to some chocolate from time to time will absolutely be a great idea.

## Natural Libido Booster #8: Celery

<p class="space">
  Okay, you‚Äôve got me here: celery isn‚Äôt really an aphrodisiac. BUT some bright minds in the scientific and nutritional world (including Dr. Mark Anderson, author of Stay Young: 10 Proven Steps to Natural Health) affirm that the phytonutrients in celery can increase the content of pheromones in male sweat. There is certain evidence that men who secrete more pheromones are generally more attractive to women. Nothing like a gorgeous beauty to spark that hidden sex drive in you, am I right? üôÇ
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #9: Ginger

<p class="space">
  In the world of phytotherapy and herbalism, ginger is a classic tonic and adaptogen, meaning that it is believed to increase vitality, fill you with extra energy, and make you more motivated to achieve your goals every single day. Some people report that it does a fabulous job in fighting back depression, anxiety, psychological fatigue, and chronic stress, making this food a promising libido booster.
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #10: Chili Peppers

<p class="space">
  It‚Äôs safe to say that chili peppers are a popular symbol of sex and everything kinky, so just thinking of that you‚Äôre already setting your mood on the right track for some bedroom action. However, that‚Äôs just the start of chili‚Äôs benefits for you. The main alkaloid of chili pepper is known as capsaicin ‚Äì an it‚Äôs this substance that gives pepper its blazing hot flavor. Capsaicin is a powerful tonic that can increase heart rate and elevate blood pressure, turning your inner engine quite ‚ÄúON‚Äù and helping to achieve some really solid erections. Just make sure to abstain from applying it topically.
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #11: Garlic

<p class="space">
  Garlic is a scientifically confirmed testosterone booster with double action: besides elevating your levels of this crucial male hormone, this delicious food also increases nitric oxide (NO) levels TWOFOLD or even threefold when taken with a good dose of vitamin C. Testosterone enhances your libido while nitric oxide improves the quality of your erections. Win-win!
</p>

## Natural Libido Booster #12: Pomegranate

<p class="space">
  Pomegranate is another classic, often included into natural libido-boosting supplements thanks for its action. Rich in antioxidants and flavonoids, pomegranate is another delicious testosterone booster that Mother Nature can offer you. Also, pomegranate is known for its ability to reduce stress and fight back depression in a safe way without any side effects whatsoever.
</p>

## Summary

<p class="space">
  Most of the foods mentioned in this fabulous list increase your libido by boosting your testosterone first ‚Äì the essential male hormone that ensures sex drive, aids in building muscle, improves physical performance and even increases motivation and aggressiveness to reach your goals.
</p>

<p class="space">
  However, take into account that the abovementioned foods will start working in about 3-4 weeks of daily consumption. If you want some quicker action, consider stacking on testosterone-boosting supplements. They are just as natural as the foods above but work faster and are much more powerful in general, allowing you to achieve better results in about 2 weeks of supplementation.

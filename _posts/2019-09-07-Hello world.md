1. Have working Jekyll template (even though it is lame without design), site is running on sevcik.dev
2. Added deploy script for Jekyll so I don't need to write same code over and over again
3. Almost all filters in WTC are working (except time), need to figure out how to filter time as it varies a lot by difficulty

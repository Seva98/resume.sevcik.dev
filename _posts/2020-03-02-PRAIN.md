Custom Splunk's app for predictive analysis of JIRA tickets to group them into clusters with similar problems.

This was a team project with 10 people.

I have been working mostly on a custom Splunk's visualization based on force directed graph and calculation of Cosinus distance in Python.

I have also developed access limitations to the app based on user roles, color synchronization between custom and native Splunk visualizations, and added multiple events for smoother user interaction with jQuery.

## What is the CrossFit Games Open 20.2 workout?

20.2 is a long 20-minute AMRAP with very short rounds.

Your score will be affected a lot by how good you are with DUs as you will be able to beat most of the people just by doing DUs in 1-2 sets.

## What is a good score to beat for the 20.2?

My guess for the **top 5%** score is slightly better than advanced athlete&#8217;s 20 rounds with about **21-22 rounds.**

All these times are based on assumption that you can do DUs. If you struggle with DUs then even 5 rounds will be good score to beat.

## Warm-up for the Open 20.2

This week&#8217;s **warm-up** should be focused on **getting familiar with movements, especially with DB thrusters.**

I would do about **10-minute practice of all three movements** and **then** finish warm up with short **EMOM** like this:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>10 Min EMOM</strong><br /> 1. Min: 2 DB Thrusters (you can use lighter weight) + 3 TTB<br /> 2. Min: 20 DUs
</p>

## Strategy for the Open 20.2

Strategy for the 20.2 will be short as the sets already consist of low reps, so there **won&#8217;t be much splitting** of reps in each set. Your **goal** should be **finding the correct pace** you can hold for 20 minutes.

I will go through each movement and try to **share my view on the strategy of every movement.**

## DB Thrusters

Each round starts with DB thrusters, which are the hardest movement of this WOD. Thankfully, **there are only four thrusters.**

You should always aim to do **all thrusters unbroken** as dropping dumbbells down in the middle of the set will cost you a lot of time.

Try to **start with thrusters as soon as possible after DUs and rest after the thrusters**. The goal is to just **get through them as quickly as possible** and focus on other 2 movements in the WOD.

## Toes to Bars

Usually, I wouldn&#8217;t split set of just 6 TTB, but I will do it in this WOD as the **total of reps over 20 rounds is 120 TTB.**

Splitting TTB to sets of **3+3 from the first round** should be a good idea as it allows you **to stay consistent on TTB** **during the second half of the WOD.**

Smaller sets on TTB also makes you slow down a little and have one extra rest which should help you **keep HR under control.**

## Double Unders

I am sorry to say that, but **you have to be good at DUs to get a good score in this WOD.**

There is not much strategy with DUs, **focus on the movement, and keep the proper posture.**

**Rest as long as you need before DUs,** so you know you can do DUs unbroken. **Top athletes don&#8217;t need any rest** before DUs, but **others** may need to **rest for ~5-10 sec to calm down HR.**

## Pacing & Transitions

**Pacing is the key to a good score.** As always, **don&#8217;t rush at the beginning**, go at a **decent pace and try to keep that pace** for a full 20 minutes.

If you have an issue with pacing, **watch the stopwatch and have all rounds in the range of +/- 5 secs of each other.**

This WOD is worth repeating after two days of rest as you can easily take your old score, calculate your pace, and make it a little faster for your second try.

**Time per round in seconds = 1200 / Targeted rounds**

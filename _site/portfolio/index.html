                    <p>Finally in 2020 after several years I’ve decided to built my online resume/portfolio to keep all information about me on one place.</p>

<p>I’ve used Jekyll for this website as in 2020 it has been my favorite static site generator. <code class="highlighter-rouge">(Vue.js - I still love you ☺️)</code></p>

<p>Site is using Bulma for styles which I’ve been using a lot during 2019/2020.</p>

<p>WTC has been created in Vue.js for frontend and with MongoDB Stitch for backend to make app truly serverless.</p>

<p>WTC also includes premium membership section using PayPal API which is connected via MongoDB Stitch.</p>

                <h2>WOD Time Calculator Blog</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>The purpose of the blog has been always to bring new visitors to the website through SEO. Articles on the blog are mostly about CrossFit workouts because WTC app’s main functionality is to calculate good times/scores to beat of such workouts.</p>

<p>From the development perspective, I have decided to never buy any WordPress theme so I created my own. Site now lives in version 4 but first three version were based on WordPress.</p>

<p>The first two version WordPress versions were built using Bootstrap. To say it easily, first site looked pretty bad, I rebuild it after a few months second time to make it more user friendly.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to make third version after about a year. It looked much better, it was nice fully featured WordPress blog. This version lived until 2020.</p>

<p>In 2020 with release of new version of web app, I’ve decided to give a blog fresh look. I’ve been very interested in Jekyll and its superior speed over WordPress. You can check current version through the link below. At least for now this version meets my requirements for WTC blog.</p>

<p>I have also developed access limitations to the app based on user roles, color synchronization between custom and native Splunk visualizations, and added multiple events for smoother user interaction with jQuery.</p>

                    <p>Custom Splunk’s app that can generate Microsoft Word and PDF reports from SPL queries.</p>

<p>I have been working on that project alone.</p>

<p>The reporting has been able to convert any Splunk search result to docx format using python-docx library and then convert it to PDF while meeting requirements of ISO 50001 reports.</p>

<p>The reporting has been made available to SPL through custom search commands.</p>

                <h2>WordPress Blog</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>My first project that I have decided to officialy release.</p>

<p>It first started as subscription service for 7 healthy recipes with detailed instructions and diet tip per month. Later I’ve focused a lot on content, email and social media marketing. After that I’ve even created YouTube channel with video recipes. I even decided to go away from making recipes to write article about fitness.</p>

<p>7 Diet Meals blog was first in the Czech after sometime I decided to switch to English.</p>

<p>The blog had several desing iterations. I’ve always followed the rule that I don’t wanted to pay for any external designers so I did all changes by myself. I’ve went through changing default WordPress themes to creating my own several times.</p>

<p>Now the site is a little mess, it is mostly because I didn’t touch it for several years. I just keep it alive as thanks to SEO and Google Ads it still makes some extra cash just by keeping it alive.</p>

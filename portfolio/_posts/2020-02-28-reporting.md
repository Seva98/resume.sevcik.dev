Custom Splunk's app that can generate Microsoft Word and PDF reports from SPL queries.

I have been working on that project alone.

The reporting has been able to convert any Splunk search result to docx format using python-docx library and then convert it to PDF while meeting requirements of ISO 50001 reports.

The reporting has been made available to SPL through custom search commands.

My first project that I have decided to officialy release.

It first started as subscription service for 7 healthy recipes with detailed instructions and diet tip per month. Later I've focused a lot on content, email and social media marketing. After that I've even created YouTube channel with video recipes. I even decided to go away from making recipes to write article about fitness.

7 Diet Meals blog was first in the Czech after sometime I decided to switch to English.

The blog had several desing iterations. I've always followed the rule that I don't wanted to pay for any external designers so I did all changes by myself. I've went through changing default WordPress themes to creating my own several times.

Now the site is a little mess, it is mostly because I didn't touch it for several years. I just keep it alive as thanks to SEO and Google Ads it still makes some extra cash just by keeping it alive.

Finally in 2020 after several years I've decided to built my online resume/portfolio to keep all information about me on one place.

I've used Jekyll for this website as in 2020 it has been my favorite static site generator. `(Vue.js - I still love you ☺️)`

Site is using Bulma for styles which I've been using a lot during 2019/2020.

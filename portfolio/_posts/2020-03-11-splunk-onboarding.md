I've been lead front end developer for Virtual Furnace application in Robotron.

The goal of this app was to take custom user model input, feed this data to API and display multiple different visualizations.

The custom model input has been very advanced and included over 100 different options how to change it.

This data has been lately processed by customer's backend which returned new model for presentation data.

Those data has been coming in intervals as calculation took several minutes to finish. Incomplete data has been displayed with live updates.

Application included multiple highly customized timecharts and tables that were displaying the model behaviour.

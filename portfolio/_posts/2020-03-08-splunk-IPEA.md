Custom Splunk's app with a collection of multiple dashboards that interprets important key performance indicators for use in energetics.

Worked on this project in team of 2.

My work included developing some of those dashboards, improving the efficiency of those dashboards by optimizing SPL search queries, preparing the app for multi-lingual use with i18n package, and fixing several bugs on older dashboards.

I have also worked on integrating this app with one of the clients.

The purpose of the blog has been always to bring new visitors to the website through SEO. Articles on the blog are mostly about CrossFit workouts because WTC app's main functionality is to calculate good times/scores to beat of such workouts.

From the development perspective, I have decided to never buy any WordPress theme so I created my own. Site now lives in version 4 but first three version were based on WordPress.

The first two version WordPress versions were built using Bootstrap. To say it easily, first site looked pretty bad, I rebuild it after a few months second time to make it more user friendly.

I've decided to make third version after about a year. It looked much better, it was nice fully featured WordPress blog. This version lived until 2020.

In 2020 with release of new version of web app, I've decided to give a blog fresh look. I've been very interested in Jekyll and its superior speed over WordPress. You can check current version through the link below. At least for now this version meets my requirements for WTC blog.
